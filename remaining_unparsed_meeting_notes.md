### Remaining unparsed meeting notes
 * Topics
   * Benefit from having a large enough project to work with
     * e.g bioinformatics -> bioKepler
     * openTopography.org
    
Statistics
   * Developing worksflow models for data-constrained models of systems.

   * Finite  state machine as model to model communication
   * UVCDat http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/
   * Bob Cook: MstMIP / model intercomparison
 
   * Anticipate key workflow/software needs for 5-10 years time
   * Workflows as a means to get the community to work together
   * If ecological forecasting is to become a reality - we need workflows to deliver that
   * Model component interoperation  - going from molecules to blue whales
   * Models (and model components) as hypotheses
   * Benchmarking models <- a perfect place for workflows
   * Scenario testing
   * Having WF system handle uncertainty would be useful
   * Need mechanism to represent model outputs and model performance
   * Identify translators for model inputs & outputs
   * e.g. Adopt MSTMIP standards for variables 
   * merging across scales 
   * end to end modeling -> is there any meaning to this?
     * Beth Fulton, Ken Rose
     * don't do it; not sufficiently adaptable
     * keep it simple, solve one prob. at a time
     * keep data in native format rather than homogenize
   * What are the low hanging fruit?
   * Optimal levels of complexity in workflow 
     * also, model complexity
   * Detection of scale shifts, using scale as object of observation
     * Auto characterisation of sig changes in ecological data and model predictions.
Identifying red flags in data observations  and model predictions
   * Transparent / efficient access to data, computing <- ability to combine both in a transparent way
   * provenance tracking -> captured as reproducible research objects
   * adopting best practices w/in community
   * business model to sustain software; combining big, heterogeneous data,

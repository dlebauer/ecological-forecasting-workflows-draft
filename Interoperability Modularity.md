# Interoperability, Modularity, Reuse
What is or can be done for improving reproducibility and interoperability in specific parts of the workflow

* Why one workflow system over another;  See comparison paper \cite{Yu_2005}
 * what are common and uncommon requirements for workflow engines
  * Data input output
  * Model component interfaces
 * What do we want in a wf engine; 


## Software Interoperability / Modularity

* Favor interoperability over re-writing / translating (except where this is useful and not redundant)
* Model coupling --> currently a Hurculean task

## Data Interoperability / Modularity 

\cite{Borer_2009} provide guidelines  <!--An example of a similar "guidelines" paper; outreach rather than findings:  -->


\cite{Wolkovich_2012}  An example of using global change to illustrate changes needed in data management:  


   * Data integration and model coupling
     * almost all existing systems don't deal in semantics
     * Try to add semantics to modelling frameworks to make it easier to build systems that understand more of the data / information compatabilities specific to the domain.

### To this end, we can take the opportunity to state some widely used conventions

 * importance to MIPs 
 * how is this related to Global carbon forecasting (see CMIP6 article in EOS) \cite{Meehl_2014}
 * MsTMIP\cite{Huntzinger_2013}, AgMIP \cite{Rosenzweig_2013}, ISI-MIP \cite{Warszawski_2014}

### Ontologies / Semantics

   * Data integration and model coupling
     * almost all existing systems don't deal in semantics
     * Try to add semantics to modelling frameworks to make it easier to build systems that understand more of the data / information compatabilities specific to the domain.


Can we describe model components semantically to provide plug-n-play within wf systems?

## Background

<!--Start with the Workshop Description-->

The scalability, availability and usability of software used in scientific workflows strongly influence the pace and direction of research in ecological forecasting.  Many independent scientists, groups, and development teams have developed customized software to enable ecological synthesis and prediction. We are looking ot move to the next step, so that scientists can transition from developing their own workflows to sharing solutions.

(perhaps an analogy to some well-enginered piece of lab equipment - Licor, GC/MS, etc, etc. - no one builds their own any more, at best you have one or more highly trained operators.

This paper will address many of the motivations and obstacles shared among these groups.
<!---_yes, but we want to be speaking to a larger audience here--> 
To do so, we focus on existing opportunities for interoperability and define a future path toward more modular and interoperable software and data. Focus on interoperable data and models and uncertainty accounting will provide the foundation for integrating models, data and statistical methods used in data-assimilation and prediction workflows. Challenges include allowing common systems for model specification, algorithm control, and output processing from these different systems so that they can be used more modularly as part of a complete workflow.

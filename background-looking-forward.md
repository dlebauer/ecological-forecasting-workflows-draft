# Computational workflows for the inference era
## Background

Formal computational workflows rarely prominently feature in scientific research outputs, even if they were part of the research methodology. Most benefits from adopting computational workflow software are obvious, such as clarity, automation and accessibility. Many of the costs are also well known, such as inflexibility and efficiency. However, a number of recent studies in computational environmental sciences have developed their own workflow solutions, sharing many features. Here we analyse why this has happened and show that it highlights a key current lack of workflow capabilities to suit the new age of computational inference based studies. Building on this, we identify features that the next generation of workflow software must possess in order to meet the demands of the inference age. These are (i) the separation of model structures, parameters and driver datasets (ii) support for multiple modes of abstraction within the same model structure (iii) the ability to overlay a traceability framework over model structures and monitor model behaviour on the basis of such a framework (iv) support for a variety of inference libraries, (v) the adoption of a provenance tracking rather than workflow paradigm (vi) the ability to structure computational workflows hierarchically (vii) distributed version control for models and data (viii) distributed and cloud based data access and retrieval (ix) remote computation and (x) a richer variety of data and model component interfaces.

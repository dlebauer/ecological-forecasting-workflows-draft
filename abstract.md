TODO: A widespread objective is to understand what processes should be represented in computational models of ecological and environmental systems. Often, when multiple models are used to simlate the same phenomena, there are at least some important aspects in which their predictions differ yet the reasons for those differences are unknown and hard to understand because of the complexity of the models being compared makes analysis intractable. Standard ways to specify, simulate and analyse such models are adopted to help improve this understanding but they are often cumbersome to implement and can still fall short of clearly indicating reasons for differences. Here we highlight advances in software and software use practices that would accelerate improvements in the development of complex models of ecological and environmental systems.

# Introduciton


## Some Definitions:
 * workflows
 * provenance
 * reanalysis, prediction, hyptohesis generation and testing
 * simulation models
 * model-data synthesis
   
Examples:

from simple (R) to complex (ARIES, \cite{Villa_2014}) 

* R ... start here because it has broad familiarity
 * Automated provenance tracking w/in R (e.g. analytic web)
    * R as a workflow itself - this is essentially folks using knitr with markdown or latex - which has very little structure other than separating text from code blocks
    * Kepler modules as frontend to R code


High Performance Computing, Big Data, 
   * Parallelization of code; access to different scheduler engines; evolving landscape
   * Workflow branches based on needs of node (e.g. I/O, flops, ram)
     * helps w/ scalability. 
   * Uncertainty, multi-scale coupling
     * how to couple independent codes; model-to-model coupling; transformation


## Big Questions / Objectives 

### Where will be be in 5-10 years

and what can we be doing now to get there

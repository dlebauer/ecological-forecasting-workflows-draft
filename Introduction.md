# Introduciton


## Some Definitions:
 * workflows
 * provenance
 * reanalysis, prediction, hyptohesis generation and testing
 * simulation models
 * model-data synthesis
   
Examples:

from simple (R) to complex (ARIES, \cite{Villa_2014}) 

* R ... start here because it has broad familiarity
 * Automated provenance tracking w/in R (e.g. analytic web)
    * R as a workflow itself - this is essentially folks using knitr with markdown or latex - which has very little structure other than separating text from code blocks
    * Kepler modules as frontend to R code


High Performance Computing, Big Data, 
   * Parallelization of code; access to different scheduler engines; evolving landscape
   * Workflow branches based on needs of node (e.g. I/O, flops, ram)
     * helps w/ scalability. 
   * Uncertainty, multi-scale coupling
     * how to couple independent codes; model-to-model coupling; transformation


## Big Questions / Objectives 

Proposal of what to work on

1. High profile perspective on the needs to get towards reproducibility in the prediction of complex multicomponent systems - for which ecological systems are a prime example but Earth System Models are another - and how advances in workflow technology are needed to achieve that - potentially with a section on case study examples of where we really need this reproducibility in order to keep advancing. Tailed by 5-10 year goal for the development of workflow technology to meet the needs of ecological / earth system research.
2. Discuss further how the specifics of conducting multicomponent multi-dataset inference based research raises new challenges for developing workflows.
3. Discuss the challenges of managing multi-component modelling with workflows 
4. A semantics for decribing workflows? Needed? Helpful?

### Where will be be in 5-10 years

and what can we be doing now to get there

## Discussion

### Some discussion topics raised during workshop

* Needs from workflow engines in the future
* Why we haven't adopted a common workflow system
* Standardising across data formats and model input output formats
* Benchmarking models against multiple datasets
* Model intercomparisons
* Red flag systems for when data and model outputs are differing from expected behaviours
* Adding semantics to model and data inputs and outputs and probabilities
* Metadata standards that will work for ecological forecasting
* state of reproducibiilty
* best practices data life cycle


### Open Questions

* Metadata/data standardization and interoperability
  * how to define and share probabilistic results?
  * easier to describe 'data' than model output

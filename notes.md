### SUMMARY AFTER MEETING 1 AND WHOLE GROUP DISCUSSION

Discussion focused on 
* Needs from workflow engines in the future
* Why we haven't adopted a common workflow system
* Standardising across data formats and model input output formats
* Benchmarking models against multiple datasets
* Model intercomparisons
* Red flag systems for when data and model outputs are differing from expected behaviours
* Adding semantics to model and data inputs and outputs and probabilities
* Metadata standards that will work for ecological forecasting

Reproducibility - would motivate adoption; esp. if demanded by journals, funding, reviewers; 
Review Paper topics
* state of reproducibiilty
* best practices data life cycle

### NOTES MADE DURING MEETING 1
 * Topics
   * Metadata/data standardization and interoperability
     * how to define and share probabilistic results?
     * easier to describe 'data' than model output
   * rOpenSci Getting data into R: what do workflows need?
     * How can we standardize data formats?
     * EML (ecological metadata language), NeXML (http://www.nexml.org/)
     * estimates of uncertainty / data quality
     * uniform API for multiple sources of data - we're working on this, so far we have 
       * taxonomy (from e.g., NCBI, ITIS, etc.)
       * spatial data (from e.g. GBIF, BISON, iNaturalist, etc.)
     * EML package: can automatically push data and get do
       * Push to KNB/DataONE/FigShare repositories
       * R package eml: https://github.com/ropensci/EML
     * Would it help to write out netcdf files from our NOAA R pkg wrapper to use in other software? And for spatial occurrence data from spocc/rgbif/etc?
     * Data transformations we could provide? e.g, Interpolation of climate data from NOAA
   * Kepler modules as frontend to R code
   * Automated provenance tracking w/in R (e.g. analytic web)
   * Parallelization of code; access to different scheduler engines; evolving landscape
   * Workflow branches based on needs of node (e.g. I/O, flops, ram)
     * helps w/ scalability. 
   * Uncertainty, multi-scale coupling
     * how to couple independent codes; model-to-model coupling; transformation
   * Why one workflow system over another; 
     * what are common and uncommon requirements for workflow engines
     * What do we want in a wf engine; 
     * See comparison paper:
       * Yu, Jia, and Rajkumar Buyya. "A taxonomy of scientific workflow systems for grid computing." ACM Sigmod Record 34.3 (2005): 44-49.http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0503025.pdf
       * 
     * 2007 workshop: taverna, triana, kepler. Covered this  question - decided that interoperability was more trouble than it is worth; compatability done by wraping one in another.
   * Invitro modeling framework (a workflow?) - model interoperability
     * modularity - componentize complexity
     * Ptolemy: Models of computation
       * See: Lee, E. A., and A. Sangiovanni-Vincentelli. 1998. A framework for comparing models of computation. IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems 17:1217–1229. doi:10.1109/43.736561     
   * The problem of the computational overhead in using workflows
   * Developing worksflow models for data-constrained models of systems.
   * Benefit from having a large enough project to work with
     * e.g bioinformatics -> bioKepler
     * openTopography.org
   * R as a workflow itself - this is essentially folks using knitr with markdown or latex - which has very little structure other than separating text from code blocks
   * Finite  state machine as model to model communication
   * UVCDat http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/
   * Bob Cook: MstMIP / model intercomparison
   * MODEL INTERCOMPARISONS <- one of the key areas of future application
   * Anticipate key workflow/software needs for 5-10 years time
   * Workflows as a means to get the community to work together
   * If ecological forecasting is to become a reality - we need workflows to deliver that
   * Model component interoperation  - going from molecules to blue whales
   * Models (and model components) as hypotheses
   * Benchmarking models <- a perfect place for workflows
   * Scenario testing
   * Having WF system handle uncertainty would be useful
   * Need mechanism to represent model outputs and model performance
   * Identify translators for model inputs & outputs
   * e.g. Adopt MSTMIP standards for variables 
   * merging across scales 
   * end to end modeling -> is there any meaning to this?
     * Beth Fulton, Ken Rose
     * don't do it; not sufficiently adaptable
     * keep it simple, solve one prob. at a time
     * keep data in native format rather than homogenize
   * What are the low hanging fruit?
   * Optimal levels of complexity in workflow 
     * also, model complexity
   * Detection of scale shifts, using scale as object of observation
     * Auto characterisation of sig changes in ecological data and model predictions.
Identifying red flags in data observations  and model predictions
   * Transparent / efficient access to data, computing <- ability to combine both in a transparent way
   * provenance tracking -> captured as reproducible research objects
   * adopting best practices w/in community
   * business model to sustain software; combining big, heterogeneous data, 
   * Lack of willing in community to adopt modularity in multicomponent models of systems
   * Managing data streams <- big data
   * Managing large volumes of data < big data
   * Big data IS an issue in certaiin areas
   * What are the workflow needs for the next 5-10 years
     * learnn from past efforts and lessons
     * Look towards future demands
   * Data integration and model coupling
     * almost all existing systems don't deal in semantics
     * Try to add semantics to modelling frameworks to make it easier to build systems that understand more of the data / information compatabilities specific to the domain.

Day 2 Discussion
-------------------------
 * Why have so many groups decided to create their own workflow rather than adapt an existing system?
   * Are ecological demands on wf systems special?
 * Can we describe model components semantically to provide plug-n-play within wf systems?

 * What are the key barriers to plug-n-play ecological forecasting?
   * Getting data providers online to not only provide read, but also write access through open APIs
   * Provide mechanism to describe a desired standard data product
     * Can be the target of data transformation as input to a model, or can describe existing raw data to decide which are transformable to that target
   * Licenses? (e.g., ESA ecological archives has unclear licenses for reuse)
   * Lack of well-specified interfaces to model components; 
Standard grammars for defining data-data and data-model and model-model interfaces

"Best practices in ecological computing" 

 * in R: Commit to S4 classes instead of S3, all languages: well-specified APIs, contractual committment
 * continuous integration e.g. Travis-CI (or is this too high level?)
 * testing (too high level?)
 * 


What do we need to do to up our game, computationally, in producing actionable predictions of ecosystems - data input standards, workflows, probabilities, cloud

Proposal of what to work on

1. High profile perspective on the needs to get towards reproducibility in the prediction of complex multicomponent systems - for which ecological systems are a prime example but Earth System Models are another - and how advances in workflow technology are needed to achieve that - potentially with a section on case study examples of where we really need this reproducibility in order to keep advancing. Tailed by 5-10 year goal for the development of workflow technology to meet the needs of ecological / earth system research.
2. Discuss further how the specifics of conducting multicomponent multi-dataset inference based research raises new challenges for developing workflows.
3. Discuss the challenges of managing multi-component modelling with workflows 
4. A semantics for decribing workflows? Needed? Helpful?

     * e.g., weather downscaling algorithm that works based on column order or specific naming conventions
   * Automate data processing (not in Excel)
     * Auditable, repeatable
     * Example
   * De-couple data from code: use data repository APIs, use open, portable data representation formats {like CSV, and NetCDF}
     * No hard coded paths
     * Isolate data I/O in separate modules (e.g., a) call to the web, collect raw payload, b) downstream processing)
     * References to data in *accessible* repository systems (e.g., via DOI)
     * Deal with access control issues (public versus private examples)
     * Version control of data (e.g., DataONE, dat, ...)
     * See diatribes about reasons to share data
     * Example from eco forecasting
   * Use a consistent error handling and propagation strategy
   * Use composable workflow systems (e.g., R, Kepler) to link components
     * Benefit: reuse and mix and match modules for various applications
     * Benefit -- documents end-to-end process
     * Example: Benefit of Automation: show LeBauer example of automation
   * Document the workflow and process and code
     * Use literate programming to link implementation to documentation
     * Doxygen, ROxygen, knitr
     * write for humans; clear variable names
   * {Provide License and metadata} - or can we ref this in other papers?
   * Formally test models
     * Separate unit and integration testing
     * Test with a wide variety of data bounds / prevent decline of model skill
   * Be aware of scaling and integration choices, use broker/wrapper components to couple components that operate at multiple scales or rates
     * Expose module constraints in documentation
       * e.g., scale constraints, normality constraints, etc.
   * Report uncertainty in input and output data
     * Can we recommend specific uncertaininty representations, or at least list them?
     * A typology of uncertainty measures, with a serialization approach
 * Education/Workforce dev and Collaboration topics? 
   * Need to train EES students e.g., software carpentry as starting point
   * Build on this with the best practices
 * Error handling (See recommendation above -- should this be in the recs section?)
   * useful messages
 * examples and/or case studies (or integrated into practices above)

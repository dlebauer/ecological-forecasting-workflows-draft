### NOTES MADE DURING MEETING 1
 * Topics

   * Benefit from having a large enough project to work with
     * e.g bioinformatics -> bioKepler
     * openTopography.org
    
Statistics
   * Developing worksflow models for data-constrained models of systems.

   * Finite  state machine as model to model communication
   * UVCDat http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/
   * Bob Cook: MstMIP / model intercomparison
 
   * Anticipate key workflow/software needs for 5-10 years time
   * Workflows as a means to get the community to work together
   * If ecological forecasting is to become a reality - we need workflows to deliver that
   * Model component interoperation  - going from molecules to blue whales
   * Models (and model components) as hypotheses
   * Benchmarking models <- a perfect place for workflows
   * Scenario testing
   * Having WF system handle uncertainty would be useful
   * Need mechanism to represent model outputs and model performance
   * Identify translators for model inputs & outputs
   * e.g. Adopt MSTMIP standards for variables 
   * merging across scales 
   * end to end modeling -> is there any meaning to this?
     * Beth Fulton, Ken Rose
     * don't do it; not sufficiently adaptable
     * keep it simple, solve one prob. at a time
     * keep data in native format rather than homogenize
   * What are the low hanging fruit?
   * Optimal levels of complexity in workflow 
     * also, model complexity
   * Detection of scale shifts, using scale as object of observation
     * Auto characterisation of sig changes in ecological data and model predictions.
Identifying red flags in data observations  and model predictions
   * Transparent / efficient access to data, computing <- ability to combine both in a transparent way
   * provenance tracking -> captured as reproducible research objects
   * adopting best practices w/in community
   * business model to sustain software; combining big, heterogeneous data, 
   * references: Madin 2007, Madin 2008, Berkeley 2005


Day 2 Discussion
-------------------------
 * Why have so many groups decided to create their own workflow rather than adapt an existing system?
   * Are ecological demands on wf systems special?
 * Can we describe model components semantically to provide plug-n-play within wf systems?  
 * What are the key barriers to plug-n-play ecological forecasting?
   * Getting data providers online to not only provide read, but also write access through open APIs
   * Provide mechanism to describe a desired standard data product
     * Can be the target of data transformation as input to a model, or can describe existing raw data to decide which are transformable to that target
   * Licenses? (e.g., ESA ecological archives has unclear licenses for reuse)
   * Lack of well-specified interfaces to model components; 
Standard grammars for defining data-data and data-model and model-model interfaces





Publishing derived data sets. 
Automated data input and output (e.g. what NEON is working on)

ncML -

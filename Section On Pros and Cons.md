## costs and benefits of workflows for enabling reproducibility and interoperability

**Pros** 

would motivate adoption; esp. if demanded by journals, funding, reviewers; 
Review Paper topics

**Cons**
 
* 2007 workshop: taverna, triana, kepler. Covered this  question - decided that interoperability was more trouble than it is worth; compatability done by wraping one in another.
 * Invitro modeling framework (a workflow?) - model interoperability
  * modularity - componentize complexity
  * Ptolemy: Models of computation
    * See: Lee, E. A., and A. Sangiovanni-Vincentelli. 1998. A framework for comparing models of computation. IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems 17:1217–1229. doi:10.1109/43.736561     
   * The problem of the computational overhead in using workflows

 
### Where in ecology and environmental science does there appear to be a compelling need?

**Pros**

**Cons**
 

### What is or can be done for improving reproducibility and interoperability in specific parts of the workflow

* Why one workflow system over another;  See comparison paper \cite{Yu_2005}
 * what are common and uncommon requirements for workflow engines
  * Data input output
  * Model component interfaces
 * What do we want in a wf engine; 

### Taking lead in identifying commonnly used conventions 

 * importance to MIPs 
 * how is this related to Global carbon forecasting (see CMIP6 article in EOS) \cite{Meehl_2014}
 * MsTMIP\cite{Huntzinger_2013}, AgMIP \cite{Rosenzweig_2013}, ISI-MIP \cite{Warszawski_2014}

### Ontologies

Can we describe model components semantically to provide plug-n-play within wf systems?

Fundamental Problems with Ontologies? (reasons for [declining interest in Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#cat=0-174-1227&q=%2Fm%2F05kvn%2C%20%2Fm%2F076h6&cmpt=q))?

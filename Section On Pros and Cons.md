## costs and benefits of workflows for enabling reproducibility and interoperability

**Pros** 

would motivate adoption; esp. if demanded by journals, funding, reviewers; 
Review Paper topics

**Cons**
 
* 2007 workshop: taverna, triana, kepler. Covered this  question - decided that interoperability was more trouble than it is worth; compatability done by wraping one in another.
 * Invitro modeling framework (a workflow?) - model interoperability
  * modularity - componentize complexity
  * Ptolemy: Models of computation
    * See: Lee, E. A., and A. Sangiovanni-Vincentelli. 1998. A framework for comparing models of computation. IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems 17:1217â€“1229. doi:10.1109/43.736561     
   * The problem of the computational overhead in using workflows

 
### Where in ecology and environmental science does there appear to be a compelling need?

**Pros**

**Cons**
 

### What is or can be done for improving reproducibility and interoperability in specific parts of the workflow

* Why one workflow system over another;  See comparison paper \cite{Yu_2005}
 * what are common and uncommon requirements for workflow engines
  * Data input output
  * Model component interfaces
 * What do we want in a wf engine; 


### Interoperability / Modularity

   * Data integration and model coupling
     * almost all existing systems don't deal in semantics
     * Try to add semantics to modelling frameworks to make it easier to build systems that understand more of the data / information compatabilities specific to the domain.

#### To this end, we can take the opportunity to state some widely used conventions


 * importance to MIPs 
 * how is this related to Global carbon forecasting (see CMIP6 article in EOS) \cite{Meehl_2014}
 * MsTMIP\cite{Huntzinger_2013}, AgMIP \cite{Rosenzweig_2013}, ISI-MIP \cite{Warszawski_2014}
\cite{Yu_2005}\cite{Yu_2005}

* We are not suggesting standards. Repeat. These are not standards. This was an important point. 

#### Ontologies / Semantics

   * Data integration and model coupling
     * almost all existing systems don't deal in semantics
     * Try to add semantics to modelling frameworks to make it easier to build systems that understand more of the data / information compatabilities specific to the domain.


Can we describe model components semantically to provide plug-n-play within wf systems?
Berkeley et al 2005, Madin et al 2007, Madin et al, 2008

Is there anything fundamentally deficient with the semantics approach? Ontologies? (reasons for [declining interest in Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#cat=0-174-1227&q=%2Fm%2F05kvn%2C%20%2Fm%2F076h6&cmpt=q))?

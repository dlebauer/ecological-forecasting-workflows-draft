## costs and benefits of workflows for enabling reproducibility and interoperability

**Pros** 

would motivate adoption; esp. if demanded by journals, funding, reviewers; 

**Cons**
 
* 2007 workshop: taverna, triana, kepler. Covered this  question - decided that interoperability was more trouble than it is worth; compatability done by wraping one in another.
 * Invitro modeling framework (a workflow?) - model interoperability
  * modularity - componentize complexity
  * Ptolemy: Models of computation
    * See: Lee, E. A., and A. Sangiovanni-Vincentelli. 1998. A framework for comparing models of computation. IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems 17:1217â€“1229. doi:10.1109/43.736561     
   * The problem of the computational overhead in using workflows

 
## Where in ecology and environmental science does there appear to be a compelling need for workflows?

**Pros**

**Cons**

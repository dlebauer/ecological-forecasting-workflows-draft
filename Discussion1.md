# Discussion

### Some discussion topics raised during workshop

* Needs from workflow engines in the future
* Why we haven't adopted a common workflow system
* Standardising across data formats and model input output formats
* Benchmarking models against multiple datasets
* Model intercomparisons
* Red flag systems for when data and model outputs are differing from expected behaviours
* Adding semantics to model and data inputs and outputs and probabilities
* Metadata standards that will work for ecological forecasting
* state of reproducibiilty
* best practices data life cycle


### Open Questions

* Metadata/data standardization and interoperability
  * how to define and share probabilistic results?
  * easier to describe 'data' than model output

## Moving Forward (5-10 years)

## Conclusion

The key objectives of this paper were to identify solutions that exist or are under development, especially those which would benefit from collaboration.

... reduce redundancies, leverage community participation, and produce the next generation of more modular, extensible software that will advance scientific discovery.

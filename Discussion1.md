# Discussion

## Moving Forward (5-10 years)


### Parallel, Sequential, and Synchronized modeling

Modularity and Interoperability.

What will / do integration of heterogeneous _codes_ as well as _data_ look like? 

* MIPS are parallel workflows (e.g. differen models of the same)
* What about sequential workflows (of complex simulation models) of, e.g. met dynamical downscaling -> ecosystem -> economics models? New opportunities for cross-domain optimization and propagation of uncertainty (e.g. dynamically coupled codes are easier to link as stocahstic equations).
* Synchronized models (e.g. where models overlap in some but not all outputs, e.g. 1) SUMO \cite{van2011multi} (climate models). This can be done, an alternative to model 'coupling', e.g. with CLM, 

### "Best Practices in Ecological Computing"

_I think we decided to stay away from this, mostly, but it is worth bringing up in the discussion_


We hope to build our community of Ecological Software Developers, Users, and Tinkerers

* Advice to specific groups, (maybe the groups are not a good idea.)
 * To the professors, we would say ... software deserves the same respect as your lab equipment, should be tested and engineered well.
 * To grad students ... get on board. Software is a technique.
* giving pointers to where to look (rOpenSci, SSI, everyone's projects)
* ... next time it seems like you _must_ be reinventing the wheel ... see if you can collaborate with someone who already has. GitHub as the open range (e.g. takes no commitment to 'fork' a project, compared to emailing a professor and asking if they will share your code, or incorporate changes)
* leaders, where to look (rOpenSci, SSI, everyone's projects), which niches each of these fill
* 


_Matt Jones ... _

What do we need to do to up our game, computationally, in producing actionable predictions of ecosystems - data input standards, workflows, probabilities, cloud

* We talked for a long time about this but ultimately decided that the scope is on par with the Software Sustainability Institute, rather than a paper like this. 
* But what are some of the key points (and how will the SSI help solve these?) (covered by Matt's talk ... 


Other things ...
 * in R: Commit to S4 classes instead of S3, all languages: well-specified APIs, contractual committment
 * continuous integration e.g. Travis-CI (or is this too high level?)
 * testing (too high level?)
 * 





## Conclusion

The key objectives of this paper were to identify solutions that exist or are under development, especially those which would benefit from collaboration.

... reduce redundancies, leverage community participation, and produce the next generation of more modular, extensible software that will advance scientific discovery.

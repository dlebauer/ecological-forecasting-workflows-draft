### Send text

* Choose a section, write some text, email it

### Using Authorea

In-web text editor, synced with github version, easy to read / edit the text [Authorea version](https://authorea.com/users/5574/articles/6752/_show_article). Email David to ask to be added as an author. Then edit in the browser. 

### Using GitHub

You can contribute a lot without using the command line. It is straight forward to edit files in GitHub, and they have a nice browser too. See the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository). The primary limitation of GitHub is that you can't view all of the sections within a single document.

 There is some learning curve to the concepts of forking, cloning, and pulling. GitHub's documentation ([click 'help' at top of page](https://help.github.com/) is great, in particular see  [collaborating](https://help.github.com/categories/63/articles) and [using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
 
#### General steps are to:

1. create a github account (https://github.com/join)
2. send username to David
3. edit anything you want by clicking the edit / pencil icon
4. [fork and clone the repository](https://github.com/dlebauer/ecological-forecasting-workflows-draft/fork)
5. Submit pull request

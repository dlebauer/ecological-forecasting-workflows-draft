## Contributing 

See issue [#6](https://github.com/dlebauer/ecological-forecasting-workflows-draft/issues/6) to provide feedback on the ease of the following workflows / if you prefer one alternative over another (or something else, like Google Docs)

### Using Authorea

For many, the easiest way to read / edit the text will be the [Authorea version](https://authorea.com/users/5574/articles/6752/_show_article)

Email David to ask to be added as an author, or [fork the document](https://authorea.com/users/5574/articles/6752/_show_article#clone-article-form) (this has not been tested, but should work). Edit in the browser. This should be the preferred approach unless we decide to use another platform. 

### Using GitHub

The Github and Authorea repositories are kept in sync using Git.

#### General steps are to:

1. create a github account (https://github.com/join)
2. fork the manuscript repository https://github.com/dlebauer/ecological-forecasting-workflows-draft/fork
3. clone (as above) but from your fork

See also the [Using GitHub and Git](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/wiki/Using-Git) primer on the PEcAn wiki page 

#### Within Github

It is pretty easy to make edits directly (e.g. try attempting to edit one of the files here (e.g. [Introduction.md]( https://github.com/dlebauer/ecological-forecasting-workflows-draft/edit/master/Introduction.md#fullscreen_blob_contents) after you have an account). It should walk you through the steps of suggesting an edit via pull request.

See the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository)

#### Desktop

Use your favorite IDE! 

There is a nice GUI tool for managing github repository https://windows.github.com/

Alternatively, use the command line
